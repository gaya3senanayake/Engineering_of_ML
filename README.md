# Engineering_of_ML
This repository consists of various Assignments that I have completed using MLflow, Evidently, Kubeflow and Deepchecks
- **MLflow**: MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the machine learning (ML) lifecycle, developed by Databricks. It helps track, reproduce, and deploy ML models efficiently.
- **Great Expectations**: Data Validation
- **Evidently AI**: Automate ML monitoring (can associate with mlflow), Handle data drift(feature drift, target drift, model performance monitoring)
- **Optuna, Ray tune (python libraries)**: Automatic Hyperparameter optimization Framework, has TPE sampler(bayesian))
- **KServe** : KServe is an open-source model serving platform for deploying and managing machine learning (ML) models in Kubernetes environments. It is designed to provide serverless, scalable, and production-ready model inference while simplifying ML model deployment.
- **MLServer** :ðŸ”¹ Purpose:

MLServer is a high-performance model inference server, designed for production-ready ML model serving.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Optimized for Inference â€“ Low latency, high scalability.
âœ… Multi-Model Support â€“ Can serve multiple models at the same time.
âœ… Custom Runtimes â€“ Supports various ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, XGBoost).
âœ… Kubernetes & KServe Integration â€“ Ideal for cloud-based production deployments.
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
MLServer loads models into memory and exposes them as REST or gRPC APIs for inference.
Can be used in Kubernetes-based deployments like KServe.
ðŸ“Œ Best for:
Production-scale model serving (high-performance API for inference).
Deploying multiple models efficiently with lower latency.
