# Engineering_of_ML
This repository consists of various Assignments that I have completed using MLflow, Evidently, Kubeflow and Deepchecks
- MLflow: MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the machine learning (ML) lifecycle, developed by Databricks. It helps track, reproduce, and deploy ML models efficiently.
- Great Expectations: Data Validation
- Evidently AI: Automate ML monitoring (can associate with mlflow), Handle data drift(feature drift, target drift, model performance monitoring)
- Optuna, Ray tune (python libraries: Automatic Hyperparameter optimization Framework, has TPE sampler(bayesian))
